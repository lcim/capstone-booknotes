## <p style="text-align: center;">BOOKNOTES - A Simple CRUD App </p>

This app is used to create, read, update and delete records (CRUD) in a PostgreSQL database. The results can be sorted according to recency, rating or author.

# To run this App successfully, 
One need to install PostgreSql locally on one's PC. One can download it from **[PostgreSql download link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)**. 
Follow instructions from the website to install it and set up your database.

Next, download pgAdmin, a GUI for working with PostgreSql server. __[Download here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)__.
One can copy the postgresql commands from queries.sql file and paste in PGAdmin to have some start-up data.
Run the command __*npm install in your terminal to install app dependencies*__
From the files downloaded here, run nodemon ./index.js and your app is up and running.
__Note:__ use your password to replace my password in the db settings in index.js file. You may keep other values the same; if you make any change in these
values especially the port number during installation, make sure to effect it within the file.

# Below is a short video clip on how the app works. Enjoy!
