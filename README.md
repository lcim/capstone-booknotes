This app is used to create, read, update and delete records (CRUD) in a PostgreSQL database. The results can be sorted according to __recency, rating or author__.

## To run this App successfully, 
One needs to install __PostgreSql server__ locally on one's PC. One can download it from **[PostgreSql download link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)**.
